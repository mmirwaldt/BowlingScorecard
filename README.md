# Bowling scorecard

### What is this project?
I have applied for a new job and my new employer wants to see how I develop software.
They give me an exercise about bowling scoring.

### What are the requirements?
They can be found Exercise.pdf.

### What are the goals?
* Create the scoring algorithm by TDD in the phases red(test fails), green(test passes) and blue (refactor).
* Micro commits which help to follow the steps
* Matches with scoring results of https://www.bowlinggenius.com/
* Deploy the web app to my server so that it can be tried out

### Which libs/framework can help?
* JUnit 5 and mockito for testing
* Spring Boot for backend
* Vaadin for the frontend to avoid frontend programming
